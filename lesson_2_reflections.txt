***What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git creates a hidden folder within the folder you initialized the repository 
in. This folder is used to store data for the repository.


***How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The working directory is were all your files are. The staging aread is where
the files you want to commit exist for the upcoming commit. THe repository is where the changes are going to be tracked and stored. 

***How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Add only the files with the changes to the staging area then run git diff --staging to see the changes.
