***How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see 
the bug that was introduced?

It alowed for far fewer things to try an look at. I am not very good
at visualy comparing text as it is easy to over look the obvious and 
very tedious. This is for small files that I am talking about. A large 
file would be nearly impossible and a big waist of time. This compare 
method is pretty awesome. 


***How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you 
a more efficient programmer in the long term?

If you discover an issue or bug with the current version you can then
work back through the changes to rebuild that feature if needed.


***What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to 
create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically 
saved, like Google docs does?

The pros to submiting manualy is that you have better controly on the
granularity of the commits. This enables for logic in the commits. The 
cons would be that it is easier to forget and not commit with the frequncy
needed.


***Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving 
multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each 
file separately?

These systerms are built for programing that can have more that one
interrelated files. These interated files need to be commited together
to easy understanding and working with commits. 

***How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history
 of files?

 Get log will show all the comments with the comment and the the get diff
 allows you to see the diffrences between commits.
 
 ***How might using version control make you more confident to make changes 
 that could break something?

 It provides a safty net to know how easy it would be to roll back to an earlier 
 version of the code. So this gives a way to be a little more bold in coding. 

***Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Version control for sure. I might use it is an app launcher too.
